 
                                   WHAT I LEARNED IN THIS PROJECT :

1. useContext  
   - Used React Context API for the first time to manage global state
   - Shared search state between Navbar, Home, and Cart without prop drilling

2. Project Structure  
   - Organized components, utilities, data, and context into a clear folder structure
   - Improved code readability and maintainability

3. localStorage  
   - Implemented user-based cart persistence using localStorage
   - Managed separate carts for different users
   - Synced React state with localStorage updates

4. State & Logic Handling  
   - Built add, remove, increase, and decrease cart item logic
   - Worked with array methods like map and filter in real scenarios
   - Improved understanding of React state updates
